Module "EI2C1"     (bean SW_I2C)
   - EI2C1_SendChar -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and 
                then writes one character (byte) to the bus. The slave address must be specified before by the "SelectSlave" 
                method or in the bean initialization section of <Slave address init> property. When working as the SLAVE, this 
                method writes one character (byte) to the bus. If the ERR_NOTAVAIL error code returned, the char is 
                successfully sent to master but the master device responds by an acknowledgement instead of no acknowledgement 
                at the end of transfer. <OnError> event is called in this case.
   - EI2C1_RecvChar -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus and 
                then reads one character (byte) from the bus. The slave address must be specified before by the "SelectSlave" 
                method or in the bean initialization section of <Slave address init> property. When working as a SLAVE, this 
                method reads one character (byte) from the bus.
   - EI2C1_SendBlock -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and 
                then writes the block of characters to the bus. If the bean is disabled (by the "Disable" method or 
                initialization), the block is moved to the output buffer if the <Output buffer size> property is different from 
                zero. The content of the output buffer is sent immediately with the stop condition at the end when the bean is 
                enabled by the "Enable" method. After the output buffer transmission, the whole output buffer is cleared. The 
                slave address must be specified before by the "SelectSlave" method or in bean initialization section of <Slave 
                address init> property. When working as a SLAVE, this method writes block of characters to the bus. If the 
                ERR_NOTAVAIL error code is returned, the whole block is successfully sent to a master but the master device 
                responds by an acknowledgement instead of no acknowledgment sent at the end of the last block byte transfer. 
                <OnError> event is called in this case.
   - EI2C1_RecvBlock -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus and 
                then reads the block of characters from the bus. The slave address must be specified before by the 
                "SelectSlave" method or in bean initialization section of <Slave address init> property. When working as a 
                SLAVE, this method reads the block of characters from the bus.
   - EI2C1_SendStop -When working as a MASTER, if the <Automatic stop condition> property value is 'no', this method sends a 
                valid stop condition to the serial data line of the I2C bus to terminate the communication on the bus after 
                using send methods. This method is enabled only if the bean is in MASTER mode and <Automatic stop condition> 
                property value is 'no'

Module "Cpu"       (bean MC9S12GC16_80)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enable maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disable maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_SetWaitMode -Set low power mode - Wait mode.  For more information about the wait mode see documentation of this CPU.  
                Release from Wait mode: Reset or interrupt
   - Cpu_SetStopMode -Set low power mode - Stop mode.  For more information about the stop mode see documentation of this CPU.
